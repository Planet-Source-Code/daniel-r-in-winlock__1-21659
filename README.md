### Description

This is a program that I wrote because people wouldn't leave my computer alone at the place I work. The program lay itself ontop at startup and disables the ctrl-alt-del buttons. You should start it from the registry rather from the autostart. Shortcuts can be deleted in DOS-mode.

Just create another string value in the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices) and type in the filename and the path to the file.

The password are stored in the VB section in the registry, and it's NOT encrypted in any way. I didn't think it was nescessary to add encryption because this app IS hard to get around ;p. I haven't found any way yet. It also starts in safe-mode. The only way know is to delete the file...

The default password is "guest"
